## PERL (3L):
## Introduction,

Perl (Practical Extraction and Reporting Language) is a programming language that has been widely used in web technology for many years. It was one of the first programming languages to be adopted for web development and has played a significant role in the evolution of the web.

Perl is particularly well-suited for tasks involving text processing, data manipulation, and system administration. In the context of web development, Perl is commonly used for server-side scripting, where it runs on the web server and generates dynamic content that is then sent to the client's web browser.

Some common uses of Perl in web technology include:

CGI (Common Gateway Interface): Perl was one of the original languages used for writing CGI scripts. CGI allows web servers to execute programs or scripts and generate dynamic web content based on user input or other parameters.

Web frameworks: Perl has various web frameworks available, such as Mojolicious, Dancer, and Catalyst. These frameworks provide a structure and set of tools for building web applications in Perl, simplifying the development process.

Templating: Perl offers templating systems like Template Toolkit and Mason, which facilitate the separation of code and presentation in web applications. Templating allows developers to define reusable templates and insert dynamic data into them, making it easier to maintain and update web pages.

Web scraping: Perl has long been favored for web scraping due to its powerful regular expression support and text-processing capabilities. Developers can use Perl to extract data from websites, automate data collection, or build web spiders or crawlers.

System administration and automation: Perl's strengths in text processing and system interaction make it well-suited for tasks related to web server administration, log analysis, and automation of routine tasks.

While Perl's popularity in web development has diminished in recent years with the rise of other languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, it still has a dedicated user base and continues to be used in legacy systems or specific niches where its strengths are valued.

## Variable, 


In Perl, variables are created by using the dollar sign ($) symbol followed by the variable name. Perl has three main types of variables: scalars, arrays, and hashes.

1. Scalars: Scalars are used to store single values. They can hold integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or boolean values. Here's an example:

```perl
my $name = "John";      # a scalar variable holding a string value
my $age = 30;           # a scalar variable holding an integer value
my $pi = 3.14159;       # a scalar variable holding a floating-point number
my $isStudent = 1;      # a scalar variable holding a boolean value (1 for true, 0 for false)
```

2. Arrays: Arrays are used to store ordered lists of values. They are represented using the `@` symbol followed by the array name. Individual elements in an array can be accessed using square brackets ([]). Here's an example:

```perl
my @fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange");    # an array variable holding string values
print $fruits[0];        # accessing the first element of the array (prints "apple")
```

3. Hashes: Hashes are used to store key-value pairs. They are represented using the `%` symbol followed by the hash name. Individual values in a hash can be accessed using curly braces ({}) and the corresponding key. Here's an example:

```perl
my %person = (
    "name" => "John",
    "age" => 30,
    "occupation" => "Engineer"
);
print $person{"name"};   # accessing the value associated with the key "name" (prints "John")
```

These are the basic variable types in Perl. Variables in Perl are dynamically typed, meaning that they can hold values of different types, and their types can change during runtime. The `my` keyword is used to declare variables with limited scope within a block or subroutine.

## Condition, Loop, Array,



1. Conditions:
   In Perl, you can use conditional statements to make decisions based on certain conditions. The `if`, `elsif`, `else`, and `unless` keywords are commonly used for conditionals. Here's an example:

   ```perl
   my $age = 25;

   if ($age < 18) {
       print "You are underage.";
   }
   elsif ($age >= 18 && $age < 65) {
       print "You are an adult.";
   }
   else {
       print "You are a senior citizen.";
   }
   ```

2. Loops:
   Perl provides different types of loops to repeat a block of code. The `for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do-while`, and `until` loops are commonly used in Perl. Here are a few examples:

   - `for` loop:

     ```perl
     for (my $i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
         print "$i ";
     }
     ```

   - `foreach` loop (for iterating over an array):

     ```perl
     my @fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange");

     foreach my $fruit (@fruits) {
         print "$fruit ";
     }
     ```

   - `while` loop:

     ```perl
     my $count = 1;

     while ($count <= 5) {
         print "$count ";
         $count++;
     }
     ```

3. Arrays:
   Arrays in Perl allow you to store ordered lists of values. You can access and manipulate array elements using indices. Here are a few examples:

   - Creating an array:

     ```perl
     my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
     ```

   - Accessing array elements:

     ```perl
     my $first_element = $numbers[0];     # accessing the first element (1)
     my $third_element = $numbers[2];     # accessing the third element (3)
     ```

   - Modifying array elements:

     ```perl
     $numbers[1] = 10;                    # changing the second element to 10
     ```

   - Looping through an array:

     ```perl
     foreach my $number (@numbers) {
         print "$number ";
     }
     ```

   - Array functions:

     Perl provides various built-in functions to manipulate arrays, such as `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `splice`, `join`, and more. These functions help you add or remove elements, manipulate the array's structure, and perform common operations.

These are just the basics of conditions, loops, and arrays in Perl. Perl offers a wide range of features and functions to work with these concepts, allowing you to perform complex logic and data manipulation tasks.



## Implementing data structure, Hash, String,

1. Hashes:
   Hashes in Perl are used to store key-value pairs. They are implemented using the `%` symbol followed by the hash name. Here's an example:

   ```perl
   my %person = (
       "name" => "John",
       "age" => 30,
       "occupation" => "Engineer"
   );
   ```

   You can access and manipulate the values in a hash using the corresponding keys. Here are a few examples:

   - Accessing values:

     ```perl
     my $name = $person{"name"};
     my $age = $person{"age"};
     ```

   - Modifying values:

     ```perl
     $person{"occupation"} = "Developer";
     ```

   - Adding new key-value pairs:

     ```perl
     $person{"city"} = "New York";
     ```

   - Looping through a hash:

     ```perl
     foreach my $key (keys %person) {
         my $value = $person{$key};
         print "$key: $value\n";
     }
     ```

2. Strings:
   Perl provides powerful string manipulation capabilities. Here are some common operations you can perform on strings:

   - Concatenation:

     ```perl
     my $string1 = "Hello";
     my $string2 = "World";
     my $result = $string1 . ", " . $string2;   # Concatenating strings
     ```

   - String interpolation:

     ```perl
     my $name = "John";
     my $greeting = "Hello, $name!";            # String interpolation
     ```

   - Length of a string:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello";
     my $length = length($string);              # Getting the length of a string
     ```

   - Substring extraction:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello, World!";
     my $substring = substr($string, 7, 5);     # Extracting "World"
     ```

   - Pattern matching:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello, World!";
     if ($string =~ /World/) {
         print "Found 'World' in the string.";
     }
     ```

   - String manipulation functions:

     Perl provides a wide range of built-in functions for string manipulation, such as `index`, `rindex`, `split`, `join`, `uc`, `lc`, `substr`, `chomp`, `sprintf`, and many more. These functions allow you to perform tasks like searching, splitting, formatting, case conversions, and more.

These are just some examples of how you can work with hashes and strings in Perl. Perl offers a rich set of features and functions for manipulating data structures and handling string operations, making it flexible and powerful for various programming tasks.



## Regular Expression, File handling, I/O handling.

1. Regular Expressions:
   Regular expressions (regex) in Perl are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. Perl has robust support for regular expressions through built-in functions and special syntax. Here are some examples of using regular expressions in Perl:

   - Pattern matching using the `=~` operator:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello, World!";
     if ($string =~ /World/) {
         print "Found 'World' in the string.";
     }
     ```

   - Extracting substrings using capturing groups:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello, World!";
     if ($string =~ /Hello, (.*)!/) {
         my $name = $1;   # Captured substring inside parentheses
         print "Hello, $name!";
     }
     ```

   - Substituting patterns using the `s///` operator:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello, World!";
     $string =~ s/World/Perl/;   # Substitute "World" with "Perl"
     print $string;
     ```

   - Matching with modifiers and flags:

     ```perl
     my $string = "Hello, world!";
     if ($string =~ /world/i) {   # Ignore case using 'i' modifier
         print "Match found!";
     }
     ```

   Perl offers many more features and functions for regular expressions, including character classes, quantifiers, anchors, assertions, and more. Regular expressions are extensively used for text parsing, validation, search and replace, and data extraction tasks in Perl.

2. File Handling:
   Perl provides various functions and operators to handle files, read and write data, and perform file operations. Here are some common file handling operations in Perl:

   - Opening a file:

     ```perl
     open(my $filehandle, '<', 'filename.txt') or die "Cannot open the file: $!";
     ```

   - Reading data from a file:

     ```perl
     while (my $line = <$filehandle>) {
         chomp $line;   # Remove newline character
         print "$line\n";
     }
     ```

   - Writing data to a file:

     ```perl
     open(my $filehandle, '>', 'output.txt') or die "Cannot open the file: $!";
     print $filehandle "Hello, World!\n";
     close $filehandle;
     ```

   - Appending data to a file:

     ```perl
     open(my $filehandle, '>>', 'filename.txt') or die "Cannot open the file: $!";
     print $filehandle "New line of data\n";
     close $filehandle;
     ```

   - File operations and checks:

     ```perl
     # Checking if a file exists
     if (-e 'filename.txt') {
         print "File exists!";
     }

     # Getting file size
     my $filesize = -s 'filename.txt';
     print "File size: $filesize bytes";
     ```

   Perl provides many more functions and operators for file handling, such as `seek`, `tell`, `rename`, `unlink`, directory operations, and file permissions.

3. I/O Handling:
   Perl provides several I/O handling mechanisms, including standard input/output and file handles. Here are a few examples:

   - Standard input:

     ```perl
     my $input = <STDIN>;   # Reading input from the user
     chomp $input;
     ```

   - Standard output:

     ```perl
     print "Hello, World!\n";   # Writing output to the console
    

# Cookies (1L):
## Definition of cookies,

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on a user's computer by a website they visit. They are commonly used in web development to enable various functionalities and enhance the user experience. Cookies are created by the web server and sent to the user's browser, which then stores the cookie on the user's computer.

## Create and Store a cookie with example.
```
use CGI::Cookie;

# Create a new cookie
my $cookie = CGI::Cookie->new(
    -name    => 'username',
    -value   => 'JohnDoe',
    -expires => '+1d',  # Expires in 1 day
);

# Store the cookie in the HTTP header
print "Set-Cookie: $cookie\n";
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
print "Cookie has been set!";

```
In this example, we use the CGI::Cookie module, which is a Perl module that provides functions for handling cookies. We create a new cookie object using the new() method, specifying the cookie name (username), value (JohnDoe), and expiration time (1 day from now).

Next, we send the cookie in the HTTP header using the Set-Cookie header field. The cookie is printed using the print statement with the Set-Cookie prefix. Note that this code assumes you are using Perl's CGI module for web programming.

When the user's browser receives this response, it will store the cookie on the user's computer. The cookie will be sent back to the server with subsequent requests made by the user, allowing the server to retrieve and use the stored information.

Remember to adjust the code based on your specific web framework or server configuration, as the process of setting cookies may vary depending on the environment you are working in.


# JavaScript (4L):
## Basics,
### Basics, Statements, comments, variable, comparison,

Sure! Here's a brief overview of JavaScript basics, including statements, comments, variables, and comparisons:

1. Basics:
   - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development.
   - It is often used to add interactivity, validate data, and create dynamic web pages.
   - JavaScript can be embedded within HTML documents or included as separate script files.

2. Statements:
   - JavaScript consists of statements, which are individual instructions or commands.
   - Each statement performs a specific action or operation.
   - Examples of statements:
     ```javascript
     var x = 5; // Variable assignment statement
     console.log("Hello, world!"); // Function call statement
     if (x > 0) { // Conditional statement
         console.log("Positive");
     } else {
         console.log("Negative");
     }
     ```

3. Comments:
   - Comments are used to add explanatory notes to the code.
   - They are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter and have no effect on the code's execution.
   - Single-line comments start with //, while multi-line comments are enclosed between /* and */.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     // This is a single-line comment
     /*
        This is a
        multi-line comment
     */
     ```

4. Variables:
   - Variables are used to store data values in JavaScript.
   - They can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, etc.
   - Variables are declared using the "var", "let", or "const" keywords.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     var age = 25; // Declaring a variable 'age' and assigning a value of 25
     let name = "John"; // Declaring a variable 'name' and assigning a string value
     const PI = 3.14; // Declaring a constant variable 'PI' with a value of 3.14
     ```

5. Comparison:
   - Comparison operators are used to compare values in JavaScript.
   - They return a Boolean result (true or false) based on the comparison.
   - Common comparison operators include:
     - Equal to (==)
     - Not equal to (!=)
     - Greater than (>)
     - Less than (<)
     - Greater than or equal to (>=)
     - Less than or equal to (<=)
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     var x = 5;
     var y = 10;
     console.log(x > y); // false
     console.log(x == 5); // true
     ```

These are some of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript. JavaScript is a versatile language with many other features and functionalities that you can explore further.


### condition, switch, loop, break. Object – string, array,

Certainly! Here's an explanation of conditions, switch statements, all five types of loops, the use of break, and an overview of objects like strings and arrays in JavaScript:

1. Conditions:
   - Conditions in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different situations.
   - The if...else statement is a common conditional statement that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true and another block if it is false.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var age = 18;
     if (age >= 18) {
         console.log("You are an adult.");
     } else {
         console.log("You are a minor.");
     }
     ```

2. Switch Statements:
   - Switch statements provide a way to execute different code blocks based on different cases or conditions.
   - They are an alternative to using multiple if...else statements.
   - Syntax:
     ```javascript
     switch (expression) {
         case value1:
             // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
             break;
         case value2:
             // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
             break;
         default:
             // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
     }
     ```
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var day = "Monday";
     switch (day) {
         case "Monday":
             console.log("Today is Monday");
             break;
         case "Tuesday":
             console.log("Today is Tuesday");
             break;
         default:
             console.log("It's another day");
     }
     ```

3. Loops:
   - Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.
   - JavaScript provides five types of loops: for, for...in, for...of, while, and do...while.

   - For Loop:
     ```javascript
     for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         console.log(i);
     }
     ```

   - For...in Loop:
     ```javascript
     var obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
     for (var prop in obj) {
         console.log(prop + ": " + obj[prop]);
     }
     ```

   - For...of Loop:
     ```javascript
     var arr = [1, 2, 3];
     for (var element of arr) {
         console.log(element);
     }
     ```

   - While Loop:
     ```javascript
     var i = 0;
     while (i < 5) {
         console.log(i);
         i++;
     }
     ```

   - Do...While Loop:
     ```javascript
     var i = 0;
     do {
         console.log(i);
         i++;
     } while (i < 5);
     ```

4. Break Statement:
   - The break statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement.
   - When encountered, the break statement terminates the loop or exits the switch statement.
   - Example with for loop and break:
     ```javascript
     for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         if (i === 3) {
             break;
         }
         console.log(i);
     }
     // Output: 0 1 2
     ```

5. Objects - String, Array:
   - In JavaScript, strings and arrays are examples of objects.
   - Strings are used to represent a sequence of characters and have built-in methods to manipulate and access characters within the string.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var str = "Hello";
     console.log(str.length); // 5
     console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // "


### Boolean, reg-ex. Function, Errors, Validation.

Certainly! Here's an explanation of Boolean values, regular expressions (RegEx), functions, errors, and validation in JavaScript:

1. Boolean:
   - Boolean is a data type in JavaScript that represents two values: true and false.
   - Boolean values are often used in conditional statements and comparisons.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var isTrue = true;
     var isFalse = false;
     ```

2. Regular Expressions (RegEx):
   - Regular expressions are patterns used to match and manipulate text.
   - They are represented by a combination of characters and special symbols.
   - Regular expressions are often used for tasks like searching, replacing, and validating strings.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var str = "Hello, World!";
     var pattern = /Hello/;
     var result = pattern.test(str); // true
     ```

3. Functions:
   - Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
   - They allow you to organize code into logical units and can be called multiple times.
   - Functions can take input values (parameters) and return a result.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function greet(name) {
         console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
     }

     greet("John"); // Hello, John!
     ```

4. Errors:
   - Errors in JavaScript can occur when the code encounters an unexpected condition or an error in its execution.
   - JavaScript provides built-in error objects, such as SyntaxError, TypeError, and ReferenceError, to handle different types of errors.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     try {
         // Code that might cause an error
         var x = y + 10; // ReferenceError: y is not defined
     } catch (error) {
         // Code to handle the error
         console.log("An error occurred: " + error.message);
     }
     ```

5. Validation:
   - Validation is the process of checking if user input or data meets certain requirements or constraints.
   - JavaScript can be used for client-side form validation to ensure data integrity and improve user experience.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function validateForm() {
         var name = document.getElementById("name").value;
         if (name === "") {
             alert("Please enter your name.");
             return false;
         }
         // More validation logic...
     }
     ```
   - In the above example, the `validateForm` function checks if the name field is empty and displays an alert message if it is. The function can be called on form submission to validate the user input.

These concepts provide an understanding of Boolean values, regular expressions (RegEx), functions, errors, and validation in JavaScript, highlighting their significance in different aspects of web development and programming.
